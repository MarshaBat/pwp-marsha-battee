		<h3>CONTENT STRATEGY</h3>

		<h4>Landing Page (Home)</h4>
		<p>The home page will feature the company logo and an image slider, highlighting photos of survivors. Over the
			slider, there will be a welcome message (e.g., a working message-- “we help you better CARE for SURVIVORS”).
			Below
			that message will be a “learn more” button. Navigation will feature a hamburger menu that links to the various
			sections (listed below) of this one-paged website.</p>

		<h4>About</h4>

			and how. Also stated will be our mission and vision for our work and in our working with clients. Likely a
