		<h3>CONTENT STRATEGY</h3>

		<h4>Landing Page (Home)</h4>

			<p>The home page will feature the company logo and a banner image, highlighting a photo of a survivor. Over the
				image, there will be a welcome message including flashing keywords (e.g., --working message-- “we help you
				'better care for' ('communicate your message to' or 'support') survivors”. Below that message will be a “learn
				more” button. Navigation will feature a hamburger menu that links to the various sections (listed below) of
				this one-paged website.</p>

		<h4>About</h4>
			<p>This section, on a nondescript background, will include our golden circle-- a brief statement on our why,
				what and how. Also stated will be our mission and vision for our work and in our working with clients.
				Likely a white or light-colored background to make the text stand out.</p>

		<h4>Our Process</h4>

				including behind-the-scene photos, sketches, or wireframes, etc.</p>

		<h4>Portfolio</h4>
			<p>This section will showcase, in a clean and simple gallery format, 3 examples of my design/development work
				with links to those respective websites. As you hoover over each block, either a color change or animation
				to the block occurs. This section will also identify the technology, process and context
				used on each project-- and case study if applicable.</p>
