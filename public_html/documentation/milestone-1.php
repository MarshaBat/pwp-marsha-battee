			<p><strong>About</strong></p>

			<p>Linda has been the Executive Director of Fairfax Medical Forensic Nurse Providers (FMFNP) for 12 years. Her career
				in nursing began on a Mother/Baby unit in 1998. Since that time, Linda has worked in labor and delivery,
				emergency departments, earned advanced degrees, and worked as a Women’s Health Nurse Practitioner (WHNP). In
				2009, Linda found her calling working as a forensic nurse and became a board-certified Sexual Assault Nurse
				Examiner for Adults and Pediatrics (SANE-A and SANE-P, respectively).</p>

			<p>Just 2 years ago, Linda was promoted to the role of Executive Director in her organization. And since her
				time at FMFNP, her organization has had a limited online presence with a website that was built around the
				time that Linda became an employee.</p>

			<p>Linda is seeking to update FMFNP’s web presence and create a user friendly site, highlighting resources in
				the community for users.</p>

			<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Update her organization’s web presence in order to support more survivors of sexual and domestic violence.</li>
				</ul>

			<p><strong>Use of Site</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>To provide information on services provided FMFNP.</li>
					<li>To connect survivors with reporting and healing resources for survivors.</li>
					<li>To keep stakeholders up-to-date on FMFNP’s initiatives and survivor services.</li>
				</ul>

			<p><strong>Tech</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Savviness: Excellent.</li>
					<li>Social Network: Only Facebook for friends and family.</li>
				</ul>

			<p><strong>Frustrations</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Linda is trying to find the money in her budget to pay for website design and development.</li>
					<li>Linda has to convince FMFP board members that investing in a new website could help them better
						support the survivor community.
					</li>
					<li>Linda’s staff is happy with word of mouth and believe that fliers, business cards and a better
						community presence through workshops and other events will keep survivors in the know. They feel that
						there’s no need for the expense.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<p><strong>User Story</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>As a user, Linda would need to be able to understand our company's design and development services and how to contact company.</li>
			</ul>
