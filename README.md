I'm definitely looking forward to seeing your content strategy and UI design concepts to come in Milestone 2α.

## Milestone 3 Feedback

- The initial design splash is eye-catching and establishes a visual vocabulary for the site in a very clear and intuitive way.  Nice!
- The rest of your design is also very solid.  You put a lot of work into making this site look good, and it shows.
- You've got some placeholder content in your portfolio, and on your phone number on the website.
- Your contact form shows up as gray text on a dark blue background, which isn't readable.
- You've got some syntax errors in your HTML that show up on the validator.
- I'm not quite sure who your target organizations are.  Organizations who help survivors of what?  This might be due to my ignorance of the industry, in which case you don't need to do anything, but you may want to consider clarifying your language around that.
- Generally, it's best practice not to include comments in your final HTML, as it adds to the filesize that has to be downloaded to get the page to render.  It'd be best to strip those out. You can always refer to github later if you need to get them back.
- Your git hygiene is excellent. Your comments are great, and most of your git commits are bite-sized.

Overall, you have an excellently designed site, and good technical habits.  You are very close to a Tier IV grade, but a few validation errors and some placeholder content keep you from the highest grade.  This is a great-looking site, and if you clean those up, you have an excellent example site to show to any potential employer or client.  Combined with your business skills and diligence, my opinion is that you have a bright future in this industry.
